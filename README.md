The E-Voting Management System is a distributed application built using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) technology. It consists of a client-side and a server-side, allowing users to participate in electronic voting securely and efficiently.

## Features

- Client-side: Implements a user-friendly interface for voters to cast their votes and view election results.
- Server-side: Manages the voting process, verifies voter credentials, and tabulates the votes.
- Secure Communication: Utilizes RMI's built-in security features to ensure encrypted and authenticated communication between the client and server.
- Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle a large number of voters and support multiple concurrent voting sessions.
